*New*
-Added preload system for audio playing in a playlist to reduce time between one track ending and the next playing

*Updated*
-Updated mobile CSS on audio search views to account for the extra space the "favorite" button uses
-Updated mobile CSS to adjust the new .subnav styles on mobile.
-Updated view.header.php to include the date as the version for the loaded CSS so that CSS changes are easier to push out if browsers cache aggressively.
