Permission system pushed into compatibility mode until it can be completed. This is to preserve existing functionality with current installs.

Added fullscreen logic to CBZ reader. Improvement to CBZ loading when first attempted index does not return image data.

Other misc improvements not pushed to live repo due to incomplete permission system.
