*Updates*
-Continuing to update older models to use new db_handler class to further minimize database queries (get_recent and get_series_members in the media extension)
-Series view has been optimized to no longer need caching system (which is good because it created many unexpected issues)
-Reworked series view page to better utilize space on desktop. Instead of each season tiling as a col-five, each season is a full column, with each episode being a col-three inside. Episodes are now read fully left to right rather than up and down and then left to right for seasons.

*Additions*
-Added complex meta direct link db handler class.
